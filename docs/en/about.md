### Introduction
![LingmoOS](../img/desktop.png)

`Lingmo GNU/Linux (Lingmo OS)` is a Linux operating system primarily focused on desktop environments. It is developed based on the open-source `Linux` kernel and is compatible with the `amd64` architecture. It features an attractive desktop environment, includes software adapted for this desktop environment, and has a unified `UI` style.

The goal of `Lingmo GNU/Linux` is to provide users with a beautiful and practical desktop environment along with a smooth experience, even on low-performance hardware.

### Lightweight, Smooth Experience
`Lingmo OS` can run on some low-performance hardware. Compared to traditional desktop operating systems, `Lingmo OS` is more lightweight and smooth.

### UI, New Desktop Environment
`Lingmo OS` adopts a new design different from traditional `KDE`, making operations less complicated. We have also optimized and restructured `cutefishDE` to make operations more user-friendly and to add more vitality to interactions and visuals.

### Built-in Spark Store
To improve the experience for Linux users, we have integrated the [Spark Store](https://gitee.com/deepin-community-store/spark-store/). Users can download needed software from the store, eliminating the need to use command lines every time to install software. Of course, you can also use the sudo command to install directly.
