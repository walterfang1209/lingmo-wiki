Fast, free and full of new features. The latest release of LingmoOS delivers new tools and enhancements for developers, creators, gamers and administrators. Let's discover LingmoOS in less than 5 minutes . Please be aware that LingmoOS is in BETA - what this means is that LingmoOS is under heavy development and therefore NOT ready for every day use. 1. Overview What you\u2019ll learn In this tutorial, we will guide you through the steps required to install LingmoOS on your laptop or PC. What you'll need A laptop or PC with at least 25GB of storage space. A flash drive (12GB or above recommended). 2. Download a LingmoOS Image You can download a LingmoOS image here . Make sure to save it to a memorable location on your PC! For this tutorial, we will use the LingmoOS 2.0 beta version which uses the new Lingmo installer that will be included in all future LingmoOS releases. 3. Create a Bootable USB stick To install LingmoOS, you need to write your downloaded ISO to a USB stick to create the installation media. This is not the same as copying the ISO, and requires some bespoke software. For this tutorial, we\u2019ll use balenaEtcher , as it runs on Linux, Windows and macOS. Choose the version that corresponds to your current operating system, download and install the tool. Select your downloaded ISO, choose your USB flash drive, and then click Flash! to install your image. 4. Boot from USB flash drive Insert the USB flash drive into the laptop or PC you want to use to install Ubuntu and boot or restart the device. It should recognize the installation media automatically. If not, try holding F12 (according to your motherboard manufacturer) during startup and selecting the USB device from the system-specific boot menu. F12 is the most common key for bringing up your system\u2019s boot menu, but Escape, F2 and F10 are common alternatives. If you\u2019re unsure, look for a brief message when your system starts \u2013 this will often inform you of which key to press to bring up the boot menu. On some older images, you will be required to enter a password to enter the live session. If you enconter this, enter the password live and press Enter . Once logged into the live system, you can start the installer by clicking Install Lingmo . Once the installer has initialised you will be invited to choose your language You can preview LingmoOS without making any changes to your PC. You can return to the installer menu at any time by clicking the Install Lingmo shortcut on the desktop. To proceed, click Next . 5. Choose your Location Select your location and timezone from the map screen and click Next . This information will be detected automatically if you are connected to the internet. 6. Choose your Keyboard Layout You will be asked to select your keyboard layout. Once you\u2019ve chosen one, click Next . 7. Choose your Partitioning This screen allows you to configure your installation. If you would like LingmoOS to be the only operating system on your hard drive, select Erase disk and install LingmoOS. If your device currently has another operating system installed, you will receive additional options to install LingmoOS alongside that OS rather than replacing it. Manual When using Manual to set up your system as you would like it, keep these thoughts in mind: The root ( / ) directory needs at least 25 GBs of space. The home ( /home ) directory needs as much space as you will need for your files, music, pictures and documents. So it is best to use the remaining space for the home partition, unless you have going to dual boot. Swap space of at least half of the available RAM is recommended. For instance, with 8 GBs, make the swap with at least 4 GBs. If you have a Windows 8 sticker on your machine you might need to make a separate EFI partition with a FAT32 filesystem. For more detailed information regarding the Disk Setup of a Linux system you can check the DiskSpace page. 8. Create Your Login Details On this screen, you will be prompted to enter your name and the name of your computer as it will appear on the network. Finally, you will create a username and a strong password. You can choose to log in automatically or require a password. If you are using your device whilst travelling, it\u2019s not recommended to keep \u201cLog in automatically\u201d enabled. 9. Confirm the Installation You will now be asked to review the settings you have chosen. If you are happy with them, click Install . And then sit back and enjoy the slideshow as LingmoOS installs in the background! \ud83d\ude42: After reboot, you can enter your new system! 10. You\u2019ve installed LingmoOS!

Required partitions Overview The easiest partitioning scheme, on a non-GPT disk, is simply a root partition and a swap partition. Name Size swap size of RAM / the rest of the disk If the disk is GPT type (this can be checked via the \\\"sudo parted -l\\\" command), you must also add a BIOS-Boot or an EFI partition depending on the boot mode of your BIOS. Name Size BIOS-boot or EFI see below swap size of RAM / the rest of the disk On some computers, a separate /boot partition may also be required. See paragraphs below. Root partition (always required) Mount point: / Type: Linux type (generally EXT4) Description: the root partition contains by default all your system files, program settings and documents. Size: minimum is 8 GB. It is recommended to make it at least 15 GB. Warning: your system will be blocked if the root partition is full. Swap (very recommended) Mount point: none Type: SWAP Description: see SwapFaq . Size: size of your RAM. Separate /boot (sometimes required) Some computers can\\'t see boot files (/boot) if located far (>100GB) from the start of the disk. This is why it is sometimes necessary to create a separate /boot partition at the start of the disk. Remark: don\\'t use the same /boot for several Linux distributions, as it may mix up their kernels. See this tutorial if you want to create a separate /boot after installing LingmoOS. Name Size /boot 250MB \\~ 1GB swap at least size of RAM / minimum 8 GB, at least 15 GB recommended BIOS-Boot or EFI partition (required on GPT disks) If you want to install LingmoOS on a GPT disk (you can check it via the \\'sudo parted -l\\' command), you will need either an EFI partition (if your BIOS is set up in EFI mode) or a BIOS-Boot partition (if your BIOS is set up in Legacy mode). BIOS-Boot partition: Mount point: none Type: no filesystem Description: the BIOS-boot partition contains GRUB 2\\'s core. It is necessary if you install LingmoOS on a GPT disk, and if the firmware (BIOS) is set up in Legacy (not EFI) mode. It must be located at the start of a GPT disk, and have a \\\"bios_grub\\\" flag. Size: 1MB. EFI partition: Mount point: /boot/efi (no need to set up this mount point as the installer will do it automatically) Type: FAT (generally FAT32) Description: the EFI partition (also called ESP) contains some boot files. It is necessary if the firmware (BIOS) is set up to boot the HDD in EFI mode (which is default on more and more modern, > year 2011 computers). It must be located at the start of a GPT disk, and have a \\\"boot\\\" flag. Size: 100\\~250MB Optional partitions Optionally, some other partitions can be created for specific usages. Be careful, these partitions reduce the flexibility of your disk space, they must be considered only if you are sure not to fill completely your root partition (which would block your system). Partition for sharing data with Windows, MacOS... (optional) Mount point: /media/thenameyouwish Type: to share data with Windows, choose NTFS. To share data with MacOS, choose HFS+. To share data with another Linux system, choose EXT4. Description: other operating systems (Windows, MacOS..) cannot read nor write in the LingmoOS partitions, but LingmoOS can read and write in any partition. If you want to share files between LingmoOS and the other systems, it is recommended to create a data partition. It is not recommended to share files directly into the Windows system partition (eg files may be overwritten by hibernation). Size: as you wish Separate /home (optional) Mount point: /home Type: Linux type (generally EXT4) Description: see HomeFolder . When your hard disk is big enough, a separate /home allows to separate your settings (and also your data if you don\\'t use a data partition, see previous paragraph) from the rest of the system. A separate /home does not allow to share data with Windows nor MacOS (see previous paragraph). Size: as you wish More Complex Schemes For more information on what various directories are used for, see The Linux Filesystem Hierarchy . More complex schemes could involve creating a separate partition for any number of the default folders used by LingmoOS. System critical folders are important to protect, and since drives, and / or partitions do fail, it is often useful to have your file system broken down into as many small parts as possible. This can be over done however. Installing every core directory to its own partition could cause a noticeable degradation of performance.\\ Bearing that in mind, the following directories should NEVER be placed in their own separate partitions: Name Description /bin This directory stores the system wide executables that are accessible by most users. /sbin This directory holds the executables used for core system functions, and used by the system administrator to maintain the system. See Note Below /proc This is a system use directory containing process information. Almost never accessed by a user. /dev This directory contains system created links to your installed hardware, and like /proc is almost never accessed directly. Note about /sbin It can be argued, and reasonably so, that moving this directory to its own partition is a wise choice. If any of your partitions or drives should fail, then this directory / partition will be the one that most likely contains the tools you will need to repair it. So while moving this would decrease performance marginally, it could also be considered a wise move. Sizes For Alternative Schemes On a six month old installation of Ubuntu 10.04.3 LTS (very old now) the disk usage could resemble something like this: (examples taken from a system with many extra packages installed) Actual Name Size Recommended Partition Size /home 179.5 GB Everything not used elsewhere, or separate drive. /usr 7.6 GB 10 GB /var 988.2 MB 2 GB /lib 599.9 MB 5 GB /boot 137.1 MB 250 MB /opt 95.3 MB 500 MB to 5 GB This directory is not used by mainline software packages, but mostly from packages coming from the universe repositories. If you do not use the universe repositories often, you probably will not need much space here. /etc 18.8 MB 250 MB /sbin 7.8 MB 250 MB /bin 6.5 MB 250 MB /dev 876.0 KB DO NOT PARTITION /srv 200 KB Unless you plan on installing web served data here, or are using a Server version of LingmoOS, this will not often need to be larger than 100 MB. If you are running a server, or plan to expand it yourself, plan ahead when sizing this. /tmp 88 KB This can get fairly large, but not larger than your swap space as a rule, so size this to match /swap /mnt 8 kB (do not partition) This is just an empty directory that serves as a mount point for temporary file systems, e.g. a rarely used network filesystem. /media 8 kB (do not partition) This contains subdirectories that are mount points for removable media like CDs and USB flash drives. The above recommendations assume you are using large modern hard drives and can afford the space. Space Requirements Absolute Requirements The required disk space for an out-of-the-box LingmoOS installation is said to be 25 GB. However, that does not take into account the space needed for a file-system or a swap partition. It is more realistic to give yourself a little bit more than 15 GB of space. Give yourself 15-25 GB to have some space left for actually doing things. If your file-system is full to the brim, you will feel some performance loss. A certain percentage of an ext3 file-system is dedicated to root, as a way of preventing a rogue process from filling the disk to the point that the system is unusable. This dedicated portion is 5% by default. Also, the anti-fragmentation strategies used by Linux file-systems require that the disk is not close to full. A rule of thumb is to keep them less than 90% full.","title":"Disk-Space"},{"location":"en/disk_space/#diskspace-for-a-linux-installation","text":"The goal of this page is to offer advice and strategy on partitioning a Linux system.","title":"DiskSpace for a Linux Installation"},{"location":"en/disk_space/#required-partitions","text":"","title":"Required partitions"},{"location":"en/disk_space/#overview","text":"The easiest partitioning scheme, on a non-GPT disk, is simply a root partition and a swap partition.
